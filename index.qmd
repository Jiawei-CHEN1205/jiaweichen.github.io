## About me

Hello! My name is Jiawei Chen, and I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering (AAE) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). My long-term research lies at the intersection of machine learning and other disciplines, with a particular focus on learning-based optimization, cooperative AI, and machine learning-driven control. The core of my work is leveraging artificial intelligence to enable decision-making and optimization for complex problems.

Specifically, my research interests include reinforcement learning for combinatorial optimization, real-time optimization and deployment in healthcare and emergency scenarios, as well as predictive control and energy optimization in energy systems. I am passionate about developing innovative AI-driven solutions to address challenging decision-making and optimization tasks across various domains.
