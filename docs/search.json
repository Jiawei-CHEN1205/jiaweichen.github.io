My long-term research lies at the intersection of machine learning and other disciplines, with a particular focus on learning-based optimization, cooperative AI, and machine learning-driven control. The core of my work is leveraging artificial intelligence to enable decision-making and optimization for complex problems.\nSpecifically, during PhD, my research interests include reinforcement learning for combinatorial optimization, real-time optimization and deployment in healthcare and emergency scenarios, as well as predictive control and energy optimization in energy systems. In the future, I am passionate about developing innovative AI-driven solutions to address challenging decision-making and optimization tasks across various domains.\n\n\n\n\nSep 2022 - Present: Ph.D. Candidate in Computational Intelligence, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China.\nSep 2018 - Aug 2022: Bachelor of Engineering in Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China."
