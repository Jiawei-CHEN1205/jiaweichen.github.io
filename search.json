She obtained her Bachelor of Engineering in Automation from Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China, in 2022. Jiawei's research focuses on the intersection of machine learning and other disciplines, particularly in learning-based optimization, cooperative AI, and machine learning-driven control. During her Ph.D., she has worked extensively on reinforcement learning (RL) for combinatorial optimization, real-time optimization and deployment in healthcare and emergency scenarios, as well as predictive control and energy optimization in energy systems."
